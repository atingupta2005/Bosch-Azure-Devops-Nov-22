# Scaling Git for Enterprise DevOps
## Lab - Git Branching Model for Continuous Delivery
- Create branch
- Make changes in the file
- Commit changes
- Merge

## Lab - Pull Requests
- Change Master branch policies in Azure Repo Branches
- Enable "Require Number of Reviewers"
	- Enable "Allow to approve their own changes"
